# Cat Clicker

Single page click tracker written with Javascript. Each cat has a separate click count being tracked. An admin panel can update the stored information about each cat, and even link a remote image file for each cat. For Udacity's Full Stack Web Development course. The function 'octopus' is a ViewModel/Controller function orchestrating changes to the model and views.

## Getting Started
Clone, or download and unzip, the project folder and open index.html in your favorite browser. Alternatively, access my [hosted project here](http://nondescript-nation.surge.sh) for a live version.

## What I Learned
This app taught me a lot about separation of concerns. The instructor changed the requirements of the app three times to simulate a dynamic project environment. My first version of the app (not in version history) was a mess of spaghetti code with functions just placed above other functions and the code that called upon it. Separating out the functions into three separate sections made it simpler to fix bugs and add new features. It also taught me the concept of the MVC pattern of writing code.
